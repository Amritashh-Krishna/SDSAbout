    <h3>The Society for Data Science, BIT Mesra is a pioneering student-run, 
        not-for-profit organization dedicated to exploring the realms of data science 
        and its diverse interdisciplinary applications.</h3><br>
    <p style=" font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 1.35rem;">Since its founding in 2019, we have united students from various disciplines 
        behind our shared passion for all things data. Our mission is to foster a strong 
        data science community on campus. Each semester, we focus on developing educational 
        learning experiences like our technical workshops and decal courses to expand data 
        science education on campus, hosting professional events for students to connect with 
        industry leaders and grow their network, and conducting analytics consulting projects 
        to help members gain experience and make an impact. Our program provides over a hundred 
        students each semester with mentorship and data science skills through working in teams 
        on a tangible group project. We aim to build an inclusive and accessible community where 
        students of all levels and backgrounds can dive into the world of data science.</p>

        <h4>1Ô∏è‚É£ Define</h4>
        <p style=" font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Data science is a "concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their 
            related methods" in order to "understand and analyze actual phenomena" with data. It employs 
            techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, 
            computer science, and information science.<br></p>
